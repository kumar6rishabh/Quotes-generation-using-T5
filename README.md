# Quotes-generation-using-T5
This project aims to generate new Quotes using T5 model from Google.

This is a simple implementation of using the T5 model for the purpose of Quotes generation. The dataset used in this project is Quotes-500k from Kaggle. The dataset was too large leading to the Memory crash and so we had to lower the size of the dataset using pandas. 

The idea was to give a prompt of lets says three to four words and make the T5 learn to create new quotes. Oviously, these quotes are not real and that was the aim of the project.

Some of the quotes generated by the T5 fine-tuned network is:
  1. Beauty lies in the midst of the chaos of the world.
  2. Sometimes, there are certain forces which come handy.
